H5P Click To Reveal
==========

Makes it possible to create click-to-reveal learning tasks for your site visitors.

This is heavily borrowed from 'H5P.Dialogcards-1.2' library.

This content type allows users to upload thumbnail images along with their corresponding enlarged media and some text accompanying it.

Whenever a thumbnail image is clicked, its corresponding enlarged media and the text is shown.

The CSS is identical to Dialogcards content type with minor changes.

TODO: Handle responsiveness and show a carousel when more thumbnail images are added (similar to an image gallery).

Please note that translations are not yet supported and this content type also lacks theming.
